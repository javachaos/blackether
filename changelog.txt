[Update 3.5.10]

Added an onyx tree (drops apples) which spawn in the new dimension and swamp biome.
You can get to the new dimension using a portal made with chiseled ether blocks.
You'll have to find the proper item used to light it. (Hint it was a useless item for a long time.)
Added a frog.
Added a few new recipes.
