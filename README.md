Black Ether Mod

Current Items:

1. Ether ore - burnable lasts a little longer than coal ore (Ether is found at level 8 or lower, most commonly between 0
   and 8, in vein sizes of about 5)

2. Block of ether - non burnable but can be placed into a blast furnace to create diamonds

3. Onyx ore - an ore slightly more valuable than diamond. can be used to craft an Onyx Pickaxe. To create Onyx ore
   simply place a diamond into either a blast furnace or a furnace and burn it to produce Onyx.

4. Onyx Pickaxe - Pickaxe slightly better than a diamond pickaxe.

5. Onyx Shovel

6. Onyx Axe

7. Onyx Hoe

8. Onyx Dust -- craftable using the stonesaw. (WIP, will add more to this later dust is currently useless)

9. Onyx Armor - craftable using onyx ore

10. Onyx fort - structures which spawn randomly 1 in every 1000 chunks, filled with loot and a few goodies.

11. This mod changes how diamonds can be aquired, a new recipe was introduced to allow the player to smelt a block of
    ether or place a block of ether into the blast furnace, to create a diamond. Cooking time in the blast furnace is 3x
    as fast.

 

The following properties exist in a file called "ethermod.properties" in the same directory as the server.properties
file (run directory)

 

"spawn.onyxforts" default value is true
"enable.onyx.biome" default value is true
"onyxfort.spawn.chance" default value is 1000 (note setting this value too low will cause issues. No less than 100 and
you're safe) (Lower means higher chance to spawn.)

NOTE: This mod requires the Fabric API
